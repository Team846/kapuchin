/**
 * Given a differential drivetrain, follow a [Trajectory] by constantly calculating left and right velocity outputs.
 *
 * The robot will follow the [Waypoint]s with a linear velocity specified by the trajectory, and an angular velocity
 * calculated with a PID loop given the error between the current bearing and the bearing of a target [Waypoint].
 *
 * Given a target [Waypoint], the robot will aim to steer towards a point extrapolated from the target and the previous
 * [Waypoint]. A shorter extrapolation distance means the robot will steer much sharper, but may oscillate on straight
 * sections. The extrapolation distance is calculated as `(currentSpeed / maxSpeed) * maxExtrapolate` so that the robot
 * will steer sharper on turns (where the `currentSpeed` is lower.)
 *
 * As the robot travels, a [Waypoint] is considered "passed" and a new target will be set once the target [Waypoint] is
 * behind x-axis of the robot (the line perpendicular to the direction of its front). This means the robot may
 * accumulate lot's of error if it slips a lot on its path and can't correct it enough, but it'll always try to
 * finish the [Trajectory] without oscillating too hard or spinning in place. For safety, the robot will abort the
 * [Trajectory] if the error exceeds safetyTolerance.
 *
 * @param scope the sensor scope of the routine.
 * @param trajectory the [Trajectory] to follow.
 * @param origin the starting [Position] of the robot.
 * @property drivetrain the tank drive drivetrain component.
 * @property maxExtrapolate the maximum target [Waypoint] extrapolation distance (varies with current speed).
 * @property safetyTolerance the maximum error the robot can be from a [Waypoint] before ending the [Trajectory] early.
 * @property reverse whether or not the robot should run with the back going forwards.
